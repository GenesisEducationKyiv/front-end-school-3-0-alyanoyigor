# ADR 0001: Decision to Choose Zustand for State Management

## Context
In case of a scaling project, it is important to have a good state management solution to avoid potential performance issues and keep the codebase clean. Without a scalable state management solution, we risk:
- Prop drilling through deeply nested component trees
- Inconsistent or duplicated state across components
- Increased difficulty in debugging and maintaining the codebase
- Performance bottlenecks due to unnecessary re-renders

## Decision

**We will adopt the Zustand library as the primary state management solution for our React application.**

## Rationale

### Simplicity & Minimal Boilerplate
- Zustand requires less setup and code compared to Redux.
- Its API is intuitive and easy to learn.
- No need for complex concepts like reducers, actions, or middleware.

### Performance
- Built on React's useState, Zustand optimizes re-renders and keeps the bundle size small (~1KB).
- Only re-renders components when their subscribed state changes.

### TypeScript Support
- Zustand offers first-class TypeScript support, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.

### Flexibility
- Can be used outside React, supports middleware, and integrates with React DevTools.

### Drawbacks and Mitigations
- **Ecosystem Limitations:** While Zustand's ecosystem is smaller, our current requirements are met by its core features. For advanced needs, we are open to building custom middleware.
- **Debugging Experience:** Zustand's DevTools integration is not as comprehensive as Redux, and state changes can be harder to track without explicit actions. But as a tradeoff, we get a smaller bundle size and simplicity.
- **Production Maturity:** Zustand is gaining adoption and is actively maintained. We will monitor for any critical issues and be prepared to re-evaluate if necessary.

## Alternatives Considered

| Solution    | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Redux**       | Mature ecosystem with many tools and middleware; Excellent debugging capabilities with Redux DevTools; Well-established patterns and best practices; Large community and extensive documentation; Predictable state updates with pure reducers | More complex setup and learning curve; Requires more boilerplate code; Larger bundle size; Often considered overkill for smaller applications |
| **Context API** | Built into React; Simple API for basic state sharing; No additional dependencies; Good for static/rarely changing data; Easy to understand and implement | Not optimized for frequent updates; Can lead to unnecessary re-renders; Lacks built-in state management utilities; More suitable for static values like themes or user preferences |
| **MobX**        | Powerful reactive programming capabilities; Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux; Good performance with automatic dependency tracking; Flexible architecture options; Works well with TypeScript | More complex reactive programming model; Steeper learning curve; Uses decorators which are still experimental in JavaScript |

## Consequences

- All new global/shared state will be managed via Zustand stores.
- Existing state management patterns will be gradually refactored to use Zustand.
- Team members will be trained on Zustand best practices.
