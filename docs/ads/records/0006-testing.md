# ADR 0006: Decision to Implement Testing with Vitest and React Testing Library

## Context
In a scaling project, it is important to have a robust testing strategy to avoid potential regressions and keep the codebase maintainable. Without a comprehensive testing solution, we risk:
- Introducing bugs during feature development or refactoring
- Regressions going unnoticed until production
- Increased difficulty in debugging and maintaining the codebase
- Slower development cycles due to manual testing
- Lack of confidence in code changes and releases

## Decision

**We will adopt Vitest and React Testing Library as the primary testing solutions for our React application.**

## Rationale

### Why Both Vitest and React Testing Library?
- **Vitest** is used for unit testing business logic, utility functions, hooks, and services. It provides fast test execution, mocking capabilities, code coverage reporting, and seamless integration with the Vite ecosystem.
- **React Testing Library (RTL)** is specifically used for UI and component testing, focusing on testing React components from a user's perspective. It encourages testing user interactions and behaviors rather than implementation details.
- **Together**, they provide comprehensive test coverage: Vitest handles unit testing of the application logic, while RTL ensures components and UI features work correctly from an end-user perspective.

### Simplicity & Minimal Boilerplate
- Vitest is easy to set up and configure, especially in Vite-based React projects.
- React Testing Library encourages testing components from the user's perspective, reducing reliance on implementation details.
- Both tools have excellent documentation and community support.

### Fast & Reliable Feedback
- Vitest provides extremely fast test execution with built-in parallelization, watch mode, and instant feedback, leveraging Vite's HMR.
- Snapshot testing helps catch unexpected UI changes.
- React Testing Library promotes writing maintainable and robust tests.

### TypeScript Support
- Both Vitest and React Testing Library have strong TypeScript support, ensuring type safety in tests.

### Flexibility & Ecosystem
- Vitest supports mocking, code coverage, and integration with other tools (e.g., CI/CD, coverage reporters).
- React Testing Library works well with other libraries and custom hooks.

### Drawbacks and Mitigations
- **Learning Curve:** Some team members may need to learn best practices for writing effective tests. We will provide onboarding and code review guidance.
- **Test Maintenance:** Tests can become brittle if tied to implementation details. We will focus on user-centric tests and avoid overusing snapshots.
- **Performance:** Large test suites can slow down CI. We will use Vitest's parallelization and only run affected tests when possible.

## Alternatives Considered

| Solution    | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Vitest + React Testing Library** | Fastest for Vite projects; User-centric tests; Great TypeScript support; Modern ecosystem; Easy setup | Some learning curve; Test maintenance required |
| **Jest + React Testing Library** | Mature ecosystem; User-centric tests; Great TypeScript support; Large community | Slightly slower in Vite projects; More configuration needed for Vite; Heavier for small/medium projects |
| **Enzyme**  | Deep component testing; Legacy support | Tied to React internals; Less user-focused; Not recommended for new projects |
| **Mocha/Chai** | Flexible; Used in many JS projects | More setup; Less React-specific tooling; Smaller ecosystem for React |
| **Manual Testing Only** | No setup required | No automation; Prone to human error; Not scalable |

## Consequences

- All new components and features will be covered by automated tests using Vitest and React Testing Library.
- Existing code will be gradually refactored to include tests.
- Team members will be trained on testing best practices.
- The project will benefit from faster feedback, fewer regressions, and higher code quality.
