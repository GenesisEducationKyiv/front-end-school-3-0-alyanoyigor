### Changes

All vulnerabilities were fixed by running `npm audit --fix`.

All outdated dependencies were updated to their latest versions as shown in the table above.

## Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Check

The project dependencies were tested for zero-day and unreported vulnerabilities using [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [GitHub Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).

### Snyk

Snyk found 2 high severity issues. Both of them are related to the `react-router-dom` package and were also reported by `npm audit`. No zero-day vulnerabilities affecting direct dependencies were found.

### GitHub Dependabot

GitHub Dependabot identified 2 high-severity and 1 medium-severity issues. The high-severity issues are the same as those reported by `Snyk`. The medium-severity issue is related to the `vite` package and was also reported by `npm audit`. No zero-day vulnerabilities affecting direct dependencies were found.

## Subresource Integrity Check

Our project doesn't load any external scripts or stylesheets directly through `<script>` or `<link>` tags - all dependencies are managed through npm packages. Therefore, we don't need to implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks at this time.

## Content Security Policy Check

Since this project's backend is not currently deployed, we are unable to perform Content Security Policy checks at this time. Once the backend is deployed, we should conduct a thorough CSP analysis.

## Summary

- Dependencies are generally secure and reliable, but most packages are not up to date. All project dependencies have been successfully updated to their most recent stable versions. 

- Notable vulnerabilities exist in `vite`, `react-router-dom`, and `typescript-eslint`, as flagged by `Snyk`, `Dependabot`, and `npm audit`. But they were fixed via `npm audit --fix`. 

- No zero-day or subresource integrity issues were found. 

- A Content Security Policy check will be performed once the backend is deployed.
