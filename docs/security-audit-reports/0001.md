## Zero-Day Vulnerabilities Check

The project dependencies were tested for zero-day and unreported vulnerabilities using [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and [GitHub Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/about-dependabot-security-updates).

### Snyk

Snyk found 2 high severity issues. Both of them are related to the `react-router-dom` package and also were reported by `npm audit`. No zero-day vulnerabilities affecting direct dependencies were found.

### GitHub Dependabot

GitHub Dependabot found 2 high and 1 medium severity issues. The high-severity issues are the same as those reported by `Snyk`. The medium-severity issue is related to the `vite` package and was also reported by `npm audit`. No zero-day vulnerabilities affecting direct dependencies were found.

## Subresource Integrity Check

Our project doesn't load any external scripts or stylesheets directly through `<script>` or `<link>` tags - all dependencies are managed through npm packages. Therefore, we don't need to implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks at this time.

## Content Security Policy Check

Since this project's backend is not currently deployed, we are unable to perform Content Security Policy checks at this time. Once the backend is deployed, we should conduct a thorough CSP analysis.

## Summary

Dependencies are generally secure and reliable, with most packages up to date. Notable vulnerabilities exist in `vite`, `react-router-dom`, and `typescript-eslint`, as flagged by `Snyk`, `Dependabot`, and `npm audit`. No zero-day or subresource integrity issues were found. A Content Security Policy check will be performed once the backend is deployed.
